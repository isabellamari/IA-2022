Some major milestones I have to add to this project are the addition of the NLTK, the key words and phrases to be flagged, and more. Now, my main struggle is learning what the NLTK is and how I will implement it into my project. After that, the rest should be aesthetics where I'll hopefully add a word box, a scrolling banner, and tie it all together.
